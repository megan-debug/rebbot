Rebbot
======
A Github pull-request rebase bot. It automatically rebases one pull request
once another has been merged. Bonus points if you can tell the bot to create a
separate pull request for specific commits. Preferably this is a service we can
make public outside of Tink, including open sourcing.

How to install
--------------
```bash
$ go get github.com/rebbot/rebbot
```
should download, compile and install the application.
